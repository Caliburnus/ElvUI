[b]General Changes:[/b]
*Changing Profiles in ElvUI should no longer require a reload.
*The profiles section of unitframes has been removed. The unitframe options have technically been reset, however if you load in with older data the UI will attempt to convert the database. If all is well you shouldn't notice any change.
*Replaced the Primary/Secondary layout portions of the Installation process with just a single layout section, this is due to being able to swap ElvUI profiles with your current spec.
*Any option that requires a reloadui is now a global option for all of your characters, in addition any option that may of required a reloadui has been reset to its default setting.
*Removed Spec 1 / Spec 2 sections of the datatext menu, there is now only one section to set your datatexts.
*Change recount icon skins again, this time desaturate them to match the skin.
*Throttle the number of times a user can send the version of ElvUI he's using to a maximum of one time per 12 seconds to cut back on lag when first joining BG/Raid groups.
*The UIScale option inside ElvUI has been removed. Use the blizzard option if you wish to scale the UI. 
*Changing the UIScale should now prompt you to reloadui.
*Profession bags should now appear to be differant colors depending on the type of bag.
*Frequent updates are no longer being used for on the power bar for the Party, Raid 6-25, Raid 26-40 groups. This should greatly increase performance inside a raid setting.

[b]Fixes:[/b]
*Fix action buttons being used while repositioning buttons.
*Add sanity check to unitframes. Users were able to attach buffs frame to debuffs frame and vice versa at the same time, causing the UI not to load properly on the next load. Adding a warning to the chat frame when a user attempts to do this, and forcing the anchor to the actual unitframe when it occurs to prevent users from making this mistake.
*Fix skada lua error when repeatidly setting embed right to skada.
*Reverting font outline to how it was in previous versions.
*Fix default bank search function not working with skin.
*Fix achievement points not displaying on achievement window due to skin.
*Character frame should no longer be skinned when the misc skin box is checked and the character frame skin is disabled.
*Fix issue with unitframe combat fade not working as intended.
