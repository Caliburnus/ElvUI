[b]Additions[/b]
*Add Profile Binds option to the general section of the config. This is a global setting for all ElvUI profiles. When enabled it snapshots your keybinds to your ElvUI profile. That way when you change talent specializations and you have the Dual Profile feature enabled your keybinds change with your spec.

[b]General Changes[/b]
*Routes and GatherMate2 addons will now use both minimaps instead of just the farmmode map.
*Change the default value of the chat block incoming whisper by level option to disabled. To prevent confusion.
*Chat frames without backdrops should now properly hide their chat tabs unless mouseovered.
*Remove the minimum requirement of .64 to the UIScale. It still however cannot go over 1.

[b]Fixes[/b]
*Fix the BNConversation prefix in chat.
*The glow feature when targeting other raid/party members wasn't updating when someone joined the party. This sometimes produced unintended results.
